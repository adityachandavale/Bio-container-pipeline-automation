Meeting 1

Date: 29/3/21

Topics discussed:

Data formats.
Pipeline basic architecture.
Container names and tasks carried out.
Input parameters and expected output.
Flow of pipeline.

Points to remember:

Raw data will be provided to first container which generates 'FASTQ' format quality check which has to be selected manually.
The obtained sequence is used as input to second container which is 'FastX toolkit' and is used to filter and extract bigger sequence for genome identification.
This is provided as input to 3rd container called 'HiSat2', which is used to allign string in big genome and generates a 'SAM' or 'BAM' file.
Next container accepts this as an input and counts number of fragments from genes. This is called 'Ball Gown' container.
Final container is called 'DeSeq2' which runs R script inside the container and generates a csv as a final output of the pipeline.
